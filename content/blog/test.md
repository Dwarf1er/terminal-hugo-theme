It's been a while since I've actively blogged and maintained my website. Moving forward, I'm committed to writing more articles. These are personal opinions and are not meant to offend anyone. I want to start discussions on topics that I deeply care about. My ultimate goal is to become a better person and contribute towards the betterment of India.
